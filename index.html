                <h3>World Generation</h3>
                <p>Designed and implemented a 2D tile-based world exploration engine. The first part of this project involved the creation of an algorithm that was able to generate worlds in a pseudo-random manner (via integer seed inputs). The second part of the project made it so that generated worlds could be interacted with–that is, users could control a customizable avatar with the W, A, S, and D keys to explore the generated worlds. This was a project in COMPSCI 61B at UC Berkeley. Watch a demo video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FN94KGwGeg&ab_channel=AndersLiu">here!</a></p>

                <h3>Wordnet</h3>
                <p>Utilized the Wordnet dataset Along with the Google NGram Dataset to build the back-end part of a browser-based tool for exploring the history of word usage in English texts (front-end code provided). This was a project in COMPSCI 61B at UC Berkeley; from the CS61B course page: “WordNet is a ‘semantic lexicon for the English language’ that is used extensively by computational linguists and cognitive scientists; for example, it was a key component in IBM’s Watson. WordNet groups words into sets of synonyms called synsets and describes semantic relationships between them. One such relationship is the is-a relationship, which connects a hyponym (more specific synset) to a hypernym (more general synset).” The tool I implemented was capable of displaying histograms of word usage as well as displaying common hyponyms of lists of words. </p>

                <h3>Percolation Modeling</h3>
                <p>Wrote a program to estimate the value of the percolation threshold via Monte Carlo simulation. Utilized the Weighted Quick Union data structure to model and calculate a percolation threshold. This was a project in COMPSCI 61B at UC Berkeley. </p>
